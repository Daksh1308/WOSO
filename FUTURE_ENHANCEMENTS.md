## Details & Implementation Ideas

### 1. Multi-shift / Break Scheduling

- Extend `SimulationConfig` with `shifts: List[Shift]` dataclass
- Each shift has start time, end time, lunch break duration
- Workers become unavailable during breaks
- Handover logic passes pending orders between shifts

```python
@dataclass
class Shift:
    name: str
    start_hour: float  # e.g., 6.0 = 6:00 AM
    end_hour: float    # e.g., 14.0 = 2:00 PM
    break_start: float = 12.0
    break_duration: float = 0.5
```

### 2. Variable Walking Speeds

- Add `walking_speed: float` field to a `Worker` dataclass
- WorkerPool assigns workers with heterogeneous speeds
- PickingProcess uses the assigned worker's speed

### 3. Warehouse Heat Maps

- Track pick frequency per product location during simulation
- Overlay heat map on warehouse grid using matplotlib `imshow` or hexbin
- Identify hot zones vs underutilized storage areas

### 4. AGV Simulation

- SimPy `Container` or `Resource` for AGV fleet
- Routing logic: nearest available AGV, charge level tracking, recharge stations
- Compare AGV vs human picking costs

### 5. Robot Picker Simulation

- Dedicated robot resource with different speed/cost params
- Mixed model: robots handle high-volume aisles, humans handle variable items
- KPI: cost per pick, robot utilization, human-robot handoff time

### 6. ML Worker Scheduling

- Collect simulation data: orders per hour, pick times, wait times
- Train model (e.g., random forest, LSTM) to predict optimal staffing
- Output: recommended worker count per hour/shift

### 7. AI Demand Forecasting

- Generate synthetic historical order data from simulation
- Apply Prophet, ARIMA, or LSTM to forecast next-day demand
- Feed forecast back into simulation config for proactive resource allocation

### 8. Multi-Warehouse Network

- Multiple `WarehouseSimulation` instances connected via `simpy.Store`
- Cross-docking: orders routed through intermediate warehouses
- Transport time between warehouses configurable

### 9. Real-Time Dashboard

- Extend Streamlit dashboard with `st.empty()` + loop for live updates
- Display current simulation time, orders in progress, queue lengths
- Use `st.line_chart` for time-series KPIs

### 10. Digital Twin

- MQTT/Kafka integration for real sensor data
- Simulation starts from current warehouse state (not empty)
- Live comparison: simulated vs actual throughput

### 11. RFID Model

- Each item gets an RFID read event at each process step
- Track item-level cycle time, dwell time in storage
- Simulation of read failures/retries

### 12. ERP Integration

- REST API connector to pull real orders, inventory, worker schedules
- Push simulation recommendations back to ERP
- OData/GraphQL interfaces
